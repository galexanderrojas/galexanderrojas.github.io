summary: A responsive web application for schedule tracking that my team developed in CSC 3700.

The Aurora University Schedule Tracker is a web application that I helped create as a team project in CSC 3700, Spring 2020. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site using the Laravel framework.

Vacay is implemented using the framework, Laravel. Within one month, we created a website that implements several types of scheduling including school buildings, professors, and class information

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MySQL](http://mysql.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
